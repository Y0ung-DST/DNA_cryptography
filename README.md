# DNA_cryptography
This program allows you to use the DNA algorithm in cryptography. 

## DNA based Encryption and Decryption Algorithm

    * Use dna_encryption.py to encrypt your message.
    * Use dna_decryption.py to decrypt it.
----------------------------------------------------------------
DNA encryption is a type of substitution encryption as it replaces each character in the message with its DNA equivalent:

> The encryption algorithm has been made with the DNA codon table, A codon table can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. The standard genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table, because when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is messenger RNA that directs protein biosynthesis :
